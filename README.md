- 👋 Hi, I’m @Starla1001
- 👀 I’m interested in python, swift and rapberry pi
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as a complete newbee to programming. I'm currently using 3 work platforms together/side by side. The book "Learn python the hard way" by Zed A Shaw, Freecode camp "Scientific Computing with Python" with Dr Chuck Severance and an app on the iphone (really good) called "learn python: Programiz". if i get stuck on one then change to another. the will make you do it 3 times. This is my learning platform at the moment and seems to work. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games that run on old mobiles
